# DP-Real-Health-System
v0.4 - improvements - added into Epoch Realism Script

Donkey Punch Real Health System

By =RAV=MusTanG

Original idea from epochmod.com/forums for hunger and thirst.
thanks to those that contributed to that thread.

The original script was only a single loop every 5 minutes or so checking on hunger and thirst.

I figured why make it so delayed, lets get it more realistic.

Then I took it farther and included many of the EPOCH debug values and made them work toward a more realistic gameplay.

This v0.4 might be the last update for this script as i have taken it even farther.

Epoch Realism will include Health, Environment and Damage. adding more realistic Health/Debug value responses.
